## Installation

- **Mac OS X**

To use these code snippets on a Mac, you have a few options for installing a C++ compiler. One option is to install Xcode and its command line tools. Another option is to use a package manager like Homebrew to install the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) on your machine.
If you already have Xcode installed, you can use the following steps to compile your code:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```git clone https://github.com/salehian/cpp-codes.git```

2. Navigate to the root directory of the repository:
```cd cpp-codes```

3. Compile the code snippets using the following command:
```clang++ -std=c++17 -stdlib=libc++ -o snippet_name snippet_name.cpp -framework CoreFoundation -framework CoreGraphics```
	Note: Replace snippet_name with the name of the code snippet you want to compile.

Here's how to install GCC with Homebrew:

1. Install Homebrew by following the instructions on the Homebrew website https://brew.sh.
Once Homebrew is installed, run the following command to install GCC:

```brew install gcc```

2. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```git clone https://github.com/salehian/cpp-codes.git```

3. Navigate to the root directory of the repository:
```cd cpp-codes```

4. Compile the code snippets using the following command:

```g++ -std=c++17 -stdlib=libc++ -o snippet_name snippet_name.cpp -framework CoreFoundation -framework CoreGraphics```

That's it! With these instructions, users on Mac OS X should be able to easily install and use your C++ code snippets with GCC installed through Homebrew. Don't forget to include any additional dependencies or requirements that users might need to install before they can use your code snippets.

- **Linux**

To use these code snippets on Linux, you can use the existing C++ compiler that comes with your distribution. Here's how to compile the code snippets:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```git clone https://github.com/salehian/cpp-codes.git```

2. Navigate to the root directory of the repository:

```cd cpp-codes```

3. Compile the code snippets using the following command:

```g++ -std=c++17 -stdlib=libc++ -o snippet_name snippet_name.cpp -framework CoreFoundation -framework CoreGraphics```

Note: Replace `snippet_name` with the name of the code snippet you want to compile.
That's it! With these instructions, users on Linux should be able to easily install and use your C++ code snippets with the existing C++ compiler on their system. Don't forget to include any additional dependencies or requirements that users might needto install before they can use your code snippets. You can also provide instructions for users who want to use a different C++ compiler on Linux, if they prefer.
